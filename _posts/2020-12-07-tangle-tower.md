No spoilers here!

*Tangle Tower* is a heavily story based game, with puzzles sprinkled throughout. You help guide Detective Grimoire: an easily distractable but thorough investigator, who is kept on track by his quick-witted sidekick, Sally. The two investigate areas in the house, and interview suspects while solving random puzzles along the way.

The goal of any murder mystery, is obviously to crack the case and find the murderer. To do this, the detective must gather clues and information to essentially recreate the night of the murder in their mind. Watching a murder mystery film is actually quite similar to playing a game. In both scenarios, the viewer is trying to use the information presented to them to put pieces of the puzzle together. In both formats, the viewer is playing a game, in a film, the games playspace occurs in the brain whereas in a game, the information can be organized on the screen. Essentially, solving the mystery in the game format is just processing information in a different way.

However, it is important to note that the difference between the act of play during a murder mystery film versus a game, is that a film can quickly lose viewers that are having trouble understanding how things fit together (unless you can pause the film, of course). In a game, unless there is a cutscene without player input explaining information, the player cannot be left behind because the pacing of the story moves at the same pace as the players digestion of the information. This is vital as to why *Tangle Tower* is such an intriguing game, player based pacing allows the story to be more complex without much risk of losing the player's understanding.

A murder mystery in the game format requires less storage of information mentally through the use of  interactive journals and notes on a players findings. In a film, the viewer must keep track of clues mentally, which severely limits the creative freedom of the plot as too much information could lead to confusion and forgetting previously important clues. In *Tangle Tower*, there are a few in game systems to store and organize collected clues and information. The game organizes information into two main categories, people and items.

The people category contains a list of all of the suspects being investigated, as well as the murder victim herself. Selecting a person shows three tabs of information: relationships, map of their alibi, and key insights. It is important to note that these tabs are completely blank when the game starts. The tabs only start to fill up with information as the player interviews more characters and finds more clues. I won't go on to explain the purpose of each tab but just know they are there.

In a game, the clues and information that are collected can be organized by the game, hopefully giving the player headspace by requiring less memorization of facts whereas in a film, the only records of information are in the viewers mental picture. However, having the game manage this information might not always be the greatest way to store info. Perhaps the game is storing too much information that obfuscates exactly what is going on whereas in a film, the viewer might be able to make connections that require less concrete information and more of a mental picture of the situation. However, I believe that is exactly the point of the game, even the name suggests that the stories are wildly tangled making it difficult to see the truth. 

In the game, nobody seems to really know why the tower is called Tangle Tower but as you get further into the game, it becomes quite apparent. The tower is named after the tangling of two families and the messy relationships and secrets each family member has. To demonstrate this, *Tangle Tower* gives each family member a locked secret, that can only be revealed once the player has collected enough information. This is universal to every family member, showing that even seemingly naive characters have something to hide.
